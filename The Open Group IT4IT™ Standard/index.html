</p></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="_the_it4it_name">The IT4IT Name
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>The business is increasingly dependent upon IT to enable their business capabilities and optimize their business value streams. IT is part of any business process and/or business product.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>As a result, IT management is becoming a critical capability to ensure sustainable business success. To manage the increasing complexity of IT and digital, an organization needs to optimize their end-to-end IT management activities involved in the planning, development, delivery, and operations of Digital Products.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>A more integrated approach is needed to optimize these IT value streams. The name “IT4IT” refers to this integrated approach of managing the IT specifically needed to enable and automate IT itself, such as portfolio and product backlog management, source code management, testing, deployment, identity management, monitoring, etc. “IT4IT” refers to all digital management capabilities and practices needed to manage the IT/Digital Product Portfolio and thus ultimately be efficient in optimizing business outcome.
</p></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="_this_document">This Document
</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>This document is the specification of The Open Group IT4IT Standard, Version 3.0, a standard of The Open Group.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Standard addresses a critical gap in the Digital Transformation toolkit: the need for a unifying architectural model that describes and connects the capabilities, value streams, functions, and operational data needed to manage a Digital Product Portfolio at scale.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Traditional management paradigms, in which the technology budget is a combination of one-off projects and keep-the-lights-on operations, have constrained the value that could be delivered by technology. A fundamentally different approach is needed.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>In recent years, this need continues to evolve rapidly as business management itself has become digital management. In other words, as the business delivers Digital Products, IT becomes the business.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>By showing how to shift the focus of digital investment from project expense to product-based value delivery, the IT4IT Standard provides a powerful model for standardizing the digital automation fabric to support constant innovation and accelerated digital service delivery.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The ultimate target is a new style of technology management – “managing digital” – in which the primary metric for measuring IT investment value (and for measuring the performance of IT leaders) is the level of innovation and measurable business value delivered by a well-managed Digital Product Portfolio.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="_the_transformation_journey">The Transformation Journey
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>The principle of product centricity shifts the focus of technology management away from the details of frictional project delivery and operations silos to a more holistic model focused instead on value-based consumption, customer focus, strong collaboration with consumers on end-to-end journeys, scalable automation, greater cost transparency, and the multi-sourced delivery of a broad Digital Product Portfolio.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Crucially, the IT4IT Standard provides a practical roadmap and blueprint for moving away from traditional practices and transitioning to a modern ability to manage digital at scale. The transition to managing digital typically includes several relevant journeys, such as moving from:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Project-based to product-based technology investment management
</p></li><li><p>Waterfall methodologies to Agile planning and development
</p></li><li><p>Silo-oriented automation models to integrated, automated DevSecOps at scale
</p></li><li><p>Reactive order-taking to effectively managed and measured service brokerage
</p></li><li><p>Opaque operational and financial reporting to effective full-lifecycle, end-to-end visibility, and control of technology investment outcomes
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="_who_benefits_from_the_it4it_standard">Who Benefits from the IT4IT Standard?
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p><em>“Building a new fully integrated approach for managing IT – going beyond the traditional process models and disjointed solution landscapes – based on a common industry data model will give an important boost to our effort of becoming a world-class IT provider.”</em></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><em>Hans van Kesteren, VP &amp; CIO Global Functions, Royal Dutch Shell, at the launch of The Open Group IT4IT Forum</em></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Standard provides an approach to making digital investment decisions and managing digital outcomes that is particularly useful for:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>C-level executives responsible for Digital Transformation, as a top-down view of digital value creation
</p></li><li><p>Product Managers and Product Marketing Managers whose portfolios include significant digital content, as a way to integrate marketing priorities with product delivery practices
</p></li><li><p>Governance, risk, and compliance practitioners, as a guide to controlling a modern digital landscape
</p></li><li><p>Enterprise and IT Architects, as a template for IT tool rationalization and for governing end-to-end technology management architectures
</p></li><li><p>Technology buyers, as the basis for Requests for Information (RFIs) and Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and as a template for evaluating product completeness
</p></li><li><p>Consultants and assessors, as a guide for evaluating current practice against a well-defined standard
</p></li><li><p>Technology vendors, as a guide for product design and customer integrations
</p></li><li><p>Technical support staff, as a guide for automating and scaling up support services to deal with modern technology deployment velocity
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="_evolution_of_the_standard">Evolution of the Standard
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>The approach put forward over the lifetime of this standard has been based on the long-standing thought experiment of “running IT as a business”, a common theme in IT management discussions for the past 40 years (see <a href="#Betz">Betz</a>, p.10 for extensive citations).
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>A history of the IT4IT Standard, including references to related standards, concepts, and industry themes, is published as a separate case study in the IT4IT Body of Knowledge; see The Open Group Case Study: <em>On the Origin of the IT4IT™ Standard</em> [<a href="#Y202">Y202</a>].
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>As part of the ongoing evolution of the IT4IT Standard, the IT Value Chain concept from Version 2.1 of the IT4IT Reference Architecture has been retired in favor of a focus on Digital Product Portfolio Management and the set of associated IT4IT Value Streams.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Value Network metaphor has been proposed to describe the broad collaboration needed to connect core practices described in the IT4IT Standard to non-technology business domains such as Human Resources (HR), Finance, Vendor Management, Customers, Partners, and Suppliers. It is consistent with the approach taken in the release to describe the standard in those terms; however, the Value Network concept has not been formally adopted by the IT4IT Forum at this time.
</p></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="_the_it4it_standard_version_3_0_release_highlights">The IT4IT Standard, Version 3.0 Release Highlights
</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>The following topics have been included/enhanced in Version 3.0 of the IT4IT Standard:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Introduction of Digital Product
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>A standard definition for “Digital Product” has been introduced. The Digital Product concept underpins and strengthens the traditional emphasis of the IT4IT Standard on treating the enterprise portfolio of IT applications/services as the primary metaphor for understanding and managing IT investment. As this thinking has matured, a “shift to product” has become a mainstream objective in IT strategy.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The updated terminology and extended Digital Product definition reflect and support this trend and its implications for financial planning, value management, organization around Agile/DevOps teams, and the exploitation of modern automation options across the Digital Product lifecycle, from strategy to support.
</p></div></li><li><p>Introduction of Digital Product Backbone
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>The concepts of service and a service backbone have been significantly improved in two ways. First, as part of the shift to product semantics, the term “service” is used primarily to describe the delivery of products “as a service” when the Digital Product is purely an act that is performed. The service backbone found in prior versions of the IT4IT Standard has been renamed “Digital Product Backbone” to account for a larger variety of topics that includes smartphones and other physical products, automated workflows, and even Robotic Process Automation “bots”. Second, the backbone has been simplified and made more straightforward, with a single primary data object at each stage.
</p></div></li><li><p>Move from Value Chain to Digital Value Network
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>The use of “Value Network” as a concept for managing IT has been introduced. In the move to Digital Product semantics, Value Network replaces the Porter Value Chain [<a href="#Porter">Porter</a>] as the top-level, business view of the IT4IT Standard.
</p></div></li><li><p>New value streams
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>The introduction of seven new value streams has replaced the four value streams of the IT4IT Value Chain of the IT4IT Standard, Version 2.1. Essentially, two value streams, “Evaluate” and “Design”, are derived from Strategy to Portfolio. Requirement to Deploy is replaced with the “Construct”, “Deploy”, and “Release” value streams; the “Consume” value stream replaces Request to Fulfill; and Detect to Correct is replaced with the “Operate” value stream. These new value streams are much more consistently and formally defined.
</p></div></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>A common question is: what is the relationship between the new value streams in Version 3 and the value streams in Version 2.1?
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Although strongly connected by data integrations and data flows, the original four IT4IT Value Streams are aligned to traditional IT organizational structures, which in most companies represented functional and cultural silos.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>As the IT4IT Standard evolved into Version 3, IT organizations were also evolving and the old silos were giving way to concepts such as cross-functional development teams, new IT investment models, and DevOps integrations of development, deployment, and operations.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The new value streams in Version 3 take this evolution of industry into account, and align with modern IT management directions that are moving ever more strongly away from silos and toward the end-to-end integration of managing digital.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>A close examination of both versions of the standard will quickly reveal the relationship between the old and new value stream definitions, and point the way to a migration path for those who have already implemented against the older version:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Four functional groups derived from the value streams of the earlier IT4IT Standard, Version 2.1
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>In the IT4IT Standard, Version 2.1 the four value streams – Strategy to Portfolio, Requirement to Deploy, Request to Fulfill, and Detect to Correct – were also defined to represent the groupings of the IT4IT Functional Components. We have preserved the groupings, but no longer refer to the groups as value streams:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Updated Strategy to Portfolio functional components
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>In Strategy to Portfolio, a Strategy functional component is introduced and significant updates have been made to the way strategy, architecture, and Digital Product work together.
</p></div></li><li><p>Updated Requirement to Deploy functional components
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>Requirement to Deploy has been upgraded significantly to reflect modern Agile and DevOps operating practices. This includes renaming some data objects and functional components to reflect the typical terms used in Agile.
</p></div></li><li><p>Updated Request to Fulfill functional components
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>Change Management has been moved from Detect to Correct to Request to Fulfill to reflect that change is an activity managed by the Deliver functions. Furthermore, Request to Fulfill sees the introduction of Identity Management, as well as the better formalization of the Service Offer Catalogs and Consumption Experience.
</p></div></li><li><p>IT Financial Management (ITFM) Support functions
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Reference Architecture has been updated to improve the description of how Financial Management capabilities are supported by the standard. Financial Management is one of the Supporting Functions in the overall Digital Value Network, and its impacts on core functions and data objects have been updated to more effectively describe these impacts and interactions.
</p></div></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Use of the ArchiMate<sup>®</sup> modeling language as the standard notation
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>The <a href="#C197">ArchiMate Specification</a> has replaced most instances of the “informal notation” used in previous releases. This generally improves the rigor of the diagrams. It also enables the automatic creation of these diagrams from the data held in the ArchiMate model of the IT4IT Reference Architecture that is available for download with the IT4IT Standard, Version 3.0. This ensures a high level of consistency across the model.
</p></div></li><li><p>Removal of the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) lists
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>The lists of KPIs associated with the four value streams in the previous release have been removed. The creation and management of appropriate metrics and KPIs for activities described in the IT4IT Standard are addressed at various points in the text of the standard. The Open Group Guide: <em>Intelligence &amp; Reporting Supporting Activity in the IT4IT™ Reference Architecture</em> [<a href="#G18E">G18E</a>] describes a recommended way of approaching metrics and KPIs.
</p></div></li><li><p>General consistency and flow of the overall standard
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>Inconsistencies of terminology and structure that were reported against prior versions of the IT4IT Standard have been resolved.
</p></div></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2 id="_related_industry_standards">Related Industry Standards

</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="sect2"><h3 id="_objective">1.1. Objective
</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>The Open Group IT4IT™ Standard, Version 3.0, describes a reference architecture that can be used to manage the business of Information Technology (IT) and the associated end-to-end lifecycle management of Digital Products.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>It is intended to provide a prescriptive Target Architecture and clear guidance for the transformation of existing technology management practices for a faster, scalable, automated, and practical approach to deploying product-based investment models and providing an unprecedented level of operational control and measurable value.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>This foundational IT4IT Reference Architecture is independent of specific technologies, vendors, organization structures, process models, and methodologies. It can be mapped to any existing technology landscape. It is flexible enough to accommodate the continuing evolution of operational and management paradigms for technology. It addresses every Digital Product lifecycle phase from investment decision-making to end-of-life.

</p></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="_foundational_concepts">3.1. Foundational Concepts
</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>At the most basic level, the IT4IT Standard defines the “Digital Management” of “Digital Products” in order to create an efficient value delivery. This is illustrated in <a href="#fig-L0-A-diagram">Figure 1</a>.
</p></div><div id="fig-L0-A-diagram" class="imageblock text-center"><div class="content"><img src="it4it/3.0/standard.singlepage/images/L0-A-Diagram.png" alt="L0 A Diagram" width="40%" /></div><div class="title">Figure 1. The IT4IT Value Delivery Framing
</div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>A basic understanding of a few foundational IT4IT concepts is necessary for any detailed understanding of the material that follows: the standard describes how <strong>data objects</strong>, <strong>functional components</strong>, and <strong>value streams</strong> interact to deliver business value. Each is discussed briefly here. Formal definitions of these and other terms can be found in <a href="#Metamodel">Chapter 11</a>.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Data objects:</strong> The most critical element of the IT4IT Standard is the identification of which information must exist and be effectively integrated for the effective end-to-end management of the Digital Product lifecycle.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The information described by each data object may be stored in a database table but the storage method is not specified by the IT4IT Standard. Likewise the format of an instance of a data object can be any relevant format (e.g., model file, source file, script, executable file, a development deliverable, a word processing document, a mail message) that can be indexed by its associated functional component.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>In many organizations, much of this information is held in informal, poorly managed, or poorly integrated systems including manual filing systems or as static documents. Part of the IT4IT Standard is about ensuring what data should be identified and which functional component should control the data object through its lifecycle.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Some key data objects make up the Digital Product Backbone: the full description of a Digital Product over its lifecycle.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Other key data objects make up the Service Offer Backbone: the data about the consumption of service delivered by a Digital Product.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Functional components:</strong> These define the minimum set of operational functionality essential for effective end-to-end technology management (e.g., Strategy, Product Backlog, Defect, Identity, Incident, and so on). Each is modeled as an Application Function whose job is to control one or more key Data Objects.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The definition of each functional component includes specific functional criteria, which are the minimum operational capabilities, data integrations, and data flows required for the coherence of the full IT4IT model.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Value streams:</strong> The architecture describes seven prescriptive value streams (see <a href="Section_3.3">Section 3.3</a> and <a href="#VSs_IT4IT-Value-Streams">Chapter 5</a>). These business views of Digital Product lifecycle management are broken down into a series of value stream stages that make use of functional components and data objects to deliver a defined outcome. For each value stream, a set of practical examples is provided in the form of business scenarios.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>How do these concepts work together? To achieve the high-automation, large-scale vision of the IT4IT model, the functional components would be software components that participate in a fully integrated automated toolchain – a “Digital Product factory” – that maintains full data traceability from concept to deployed Digital Product and delivered service, and for which all value streams and associated data flows and integrations are automated based on a common IT4IT architecture.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="_top_down_decomposition_of_the_it4it_architecture">3.2. Top-Down Decomposition of the IT4IT Architecture
</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Standard is about defining the value stream, the associated functions, and the data objects needed to control the planning, development, delivery, and run management of Digital Products. This can be seen as a factory for digital.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>In the rest of this chapter we will outline:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>The groups of functionality needed for managing digital
</p></li><li><p>The decomposition of the digital value stream
</p></li><li><p>The necessary underlying functionality and data models
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The detailed normative definition of this can be found in Chapters 5 to 10.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="Section_3.3">3.3. The IT4IT Functionality Groups
</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>Functionality groups provide an abstraction of what is needed to manage the new digital reality in a way that helps to simplify conversations between interested stakeholders. In the IT4IT Standard, we use it to describe a collection of functionality and data that is responsible for a well-defined part of the overall value creation. We describe the groups at a high level, and we decompose one level to have well-defined categories for defining the Supporting Functionality.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Standard defines four IT4IT groups of functions that deliver the outcome for the high-level IT4IT Value Streams. These are known from previous versions of the IT4IT Standard as making up the IT4IT Value Chain:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p><a href="#L1G_Strategy-to-Portfolio">Chapter 6</a> defines the functionality used to manage a digital strategy and portfolio
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>This was formerly known as the Strategy to Portfolio (S2P) value stream.
</p></div></li><li><p><a href="#L1G_Requirement-to-Deploy">Chapter 7</a> defines the functionality used to build a Digital Product from its defined requirements
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>This was formerly known as the Requirement to Deploy (R2D) value stream.
</p></div></li><li><p><a href="#L1G_Request-to-Fulfill">Chapter 8</a> defines the functionality used to deploy and consume a Digital Product
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>This was formerly known as the Request to Fulfill (R2F) value stream.
</p></div></li><li><p><a href="#L1G_Detect-to-Correct">Chapter 9</a> defines the need functionality used to detect issues and correct them in order to ensure products run as expected
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>This was formerly known as the Detect to Correct (D2C) value stream.
</p></div></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>In addition to these four IT4IT functional groups, digital management depends on a set of Supporting Functions. The IT4IT Standard defines six of these in <a href="#L1G_Supporting">Chapter 10</a>.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Supporting Functions are only defined in terms of the minimum functionality they need to deliver in order to support the core of the IT4IT Reference Architecture. Other standards define these capabilities in much more detail and it is not our aim to compete with these standards.

</div></div><div class="paragraph"><p><a href="#fig-L0-A3-diagram">Figure 2</a> illustrates how the capabilities work together, with the IT4IT Value Streams and the associated decomposition of the concept of a Digital Product.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="_the_digital_value_network">3.4. The Digital Value Network
</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>A traditional model for defining factories is Porter’s Value Chain concept [<a href="#Porter">Porter</a>]. This revision of the IT4IT Standard breaks with the Value Chain model and moves to the more recent concept of the Value Network. This reflects that value creation is a complex interaction within many systems and organizations.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>In <a href="#fig-L0-A1-diagram">Figure 3</a>, it is recognized that in addition to the core value stream for managing digital, a complex interaction with a number of supporting capabilities in an enterprise is needed. These functions are not at the heart of the IT4IT Standard, as other standards and frameworks have these functions and capabilities as a focal point.
</p></div><div id="fig-L0-A1-diagram" class="imageblock text-center"><div class="content"><img src="it4it/3.0/standard.singlepage/images/L0-A1-diagram.png" alt="L0 A1 diagram" /></div><div class="title">Figure 3. The IT4IT Supporting Capabilities
</div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Value Network is further defined through the interaction of the Digital Product with customers, business partners, vendors, as well as government and regulatory entities. The Digital Product is creating value for its consumers. The business partners and service providers can both provide resources for delivering Digital Products as well as creating their own value using the Digital Products delivered through the IT4IT Standard. As you develop Digital Products you must comply with government and regulatory rules and thus participate in the value creation of society; see <a href="#fig-L0-A2-diagram">Figure 4</a>.

</div></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="_the_seven_it4it_value_streams">3.5. The Seven IT4IT Value Streams
</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>For the second decomposition, a split is made with the Digital Product as an abstract entity in a set of data objects that form the essence of the Digital Product Backbone. This is complemented with seven new value streams that, together, explain how to define and manage the delivery of digital value.
</p></div><div id="fig-L0-B-diagram" class="imageblock text-center"><div class="content"><img src="it4it/3.0/standard.singlepage/images/L0-B-diagram.png" alt="L0 B diagram" width="60%" /></div><div class="title">Figure 5. The IT4IT Value Streams
</div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>A value stream is a representation of an end-to-end collection of value-adding activities that create an overall result for a customer, stakeholder, or end user. For more detailed treatment of the definition of value streams; see the <em>TOGAF Series Guide: Value Streams</em> [<a href="#G178">G178</a>].
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>As shown in <a href="#fig-L0-B-diagram">Figure 5</a>, the complete set of value streams depicts the various ways in which an organization orchestrates its capabilities to create stakeholder value through Digital Products. The value stream has a direct linkage to an organization’s business model (specifically to the value proposition). As an organization translates its business model to an operating model, those value stream stages can be translated into digital delivery processes as well as related data objects, tools, integrations, etc.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>This document defines the following seven value streams: Evaluate, Design, Construct, Deploy, Release, Consume, and Operate.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>These value streams are briefly introduced and described in the following sections.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="_evaluate">3.5.1. Evaluate
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>The Evaluate value stream is about the continuous assessment and evaluation of the entire Digital Product Portfolio to optimize the alignment of the Product Portfolio with the business strategy, including the identification of new Digital Product opportunities that support business and technology objectives.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Evaluate value stream is described formally in <a href="#VS_Evaluate">Section 5.1</a>.
</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="_explore">3.5.2. Design
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>The Design value stream continuously explores new features and/or future directions of a Digital Product aligned with strategic direction and business needs. It ensures the Product Design evolves to facilitate innovation and optimize business outcomes.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Design value stream is described formally in <a href="#VS_Design">Section 5.2</a>.
</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="_integrate">3.5.3. Construct
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>The Construct value stream continuously designs and builds new Product Releases and makes them ready for deployment to the market or the business. The Product Release is not limited to software development; this value stream is also applicable for the development of infrastructure building blocks and workplace services. The Product Release may be as large as an entire new product or as small as a hotfix or a patch.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Construct value stream is described formally in <a href="#VS_Construct">Section 5.3</a>.
</p></div><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="_deploy">3.5.4. Deploy
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>The Deploy value stream deploys a Product Release into a production/operating environment (creating a new instance or updating/removing an existing instance). The scope of this value stream includes many different strategies for deploying Product Releases.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Deploy value stream is described formally in <a href="#VS_Deploy">Section 5.4</a>.
</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="_release">3.5.5. Release
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>The Release value stream provides consumers with digital Service Offers that represent a new instance of a Digital Product or a change (including decommissioning) to an existing instance. A Service Offer defines how to subscribe to a Digital Product and all other lifecycle interactions the instance will have with its consumers, stakeholders, and support. The Service Offer can be made available for consumption through a self-service portal or through Application Program Interfaces (APIs).
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Release value stream is described formally in <a href="#VS_Release">Section 5.5</a>.
</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="_consume">3.5.6. Consume
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>The Consume value stream is triggered when an entitled human or system actor accepts a Service Offer related to a Digital Product. The value stream should support customer self-service and is not limited to a single engagement channel. It orchestrates the actions required to fulfill consumption of the offered service to ensure that the desired Digital Product is delivered within the agreed terms.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Consume value stream is described formally in <a href="#VS_Consume">Section 5.6</a>.
</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="_operate">3.5.7. Operate
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>The Operate value stream manages the continuous operations of a deployed instance of a Digital Product in a continuous manner. It is responsible for maintaining availability and performance within the boundaries of agreed Service Contracts. The scope of this value stream includes managing any compliance and security aspects of running Digital Product Instances and underlying systems.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Operate value stream is described formally in <a href="#VS_Operate">Section 5.7</a>.
</p></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="_introducing_functional_components_and_the_data_model">3.6. Introducing Functional Components and the Data Model
</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>The seven IT4IT Value Streams are defined in <a href="#VSs_IT4IT-Value-Streams">Chapter 5</a>. Each IT4IT Value Stream depends upon an end-to-end flow of work – via data objects – through multiple functional components to deliver the expected result for the customer, stakeholder, or end user.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Standard defines functional components as the application building blocks for managing Digital Products. Related functional components are associated together into four functional groups. A further decomposition is made from the four high-level functional groups into eight (sub-functional groups that must be established in order to manage Digital Products: Strategy, Portfolio, Develop, Test, Consume, Fulfill, Support, and Assure.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Each functional group manages one or more data objects which are controlled by applications. The integrated data objects comprise the Digital Product Backbone and Service Offer Backbone which ensure traceability through the Digital Product Management lifecycle.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>While the IT4IT Value Streams orchestrate, consume and/modify multiple data objects in the flow of work to deliver value, we provide a high-level visualization in <a href="#fig-L0-C-diagram">Figure 6</a> where we highlight only the backbone data objects.
</p></div><div id="fig-L0-C-diagram" class="imageblock text-center"><div class="content"><img src="it4it/3.0/standard.singlepage/images/L0-C-diagram.png" alt="L0 C diagram" /></div><div class="title">Figure 6. The IT4IT Functional Groups, Value Streams, and Associated Digital Product and Service Offer Backbones
</div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>These eight functional groups shown in <a href="#fig-L1-diagram">Figure 7</a> are then populated by 33 functional components that control 44 key data objects. The 44 data objects are manipulated as the seven value streams are exercised: exploring, integrating, deploying, releasing, consuming, operating, and evaluating the Digital Products. The data objects are related to each other and in <a href="#fig-L1-diagram">Figure 7</a> we show some of the most important relations. For the full list of relations and their associated cardinality see Chapters 6 to 10.

</div></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="_concepts_recap">3.7. Concepts Recap
</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Standard defines seven value streams that manage the Digital Products. Information on the Digital Products is tracked through a set of interconnected data objects managed by functional components. These are the components at the center of delivering the digital management capabilities, as illustrated in <a href="#fig-IT4IT-concepts-and-relationship">Figure 8</a>.

</div></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2 id="Digital_Product">4. Digital Product
</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>This chapter describes the Digital Product: the single, simple, unifying entity referenced over the full management lifecycle and across all the value streams in the IT4IT Standard.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The rationale behind the Digital Product-oriented thinking is The Open Group White Paper <em>The Shift to Digital Product: A Full Lifecycle Perspective</em> [<a href="#W205">W205</a>], where a proposed Digital Product definition, with examples, was initially documented and a proposal was made to evolve the IT4IT Standard in order to better address its full lifecycle management intent with a product-oriented technology management model, which replaces the traditional practice of viewing IT investment as a combination of project and run costs spread across loosely-coupled silos.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Managing the Digital Product Portfolio becomes the focal point of all IT investment. The Digital Product owner becomes accountable for all value-creation activities associated with a product, from funding through support activities.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>This approach integrates traditional Product Management acumen with IT management disciplines. It applies to internally and externally consumed digital offerings. In Enterprise Architecture terms, the consumer of a Digital Product is an actor – individual, organization, or machine.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Only the most granular Digital Products are simple: what seems like a single product to the consumer will usually be made up of a recursive array of sub-products.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Digital Product is a unifying concept that aligns end-to-end management activities ranging from business strategy through Product Management, development, consumer interactions, and operational support. It promotes cooperation across the disparate roles needed to support cross-functional automation and scaling up of Lean, Agile, and DevOps approaches to software delivery. Team members can better understand what they are working on, and what consumers they serve.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The integrated data objects that comprise the Digital Product Backbone provides the full end-to-end description of a Digital Product. The backbone ensures traceability through the lifecycle, which is required to understand all phases of managing the Digital Product, its impact on consumers, and how consumer experience is traced back to initial investments; see <a href="#fig-L0-A3-diagram">Figure 2</a>.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="_merging_application_service_and_products">4.1. Merging “Application”, “Service”, and “Products”
</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>In the IT4IT Standard, Version 2.1 [<a href="#C171">C171</a>] and in typical IT Service Management (ITSM) practices, the term “service” has been used to describe the core consumable output that the IT organization will manage throughout its lifecycle.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>“Application” is a common term that overlaps “service” in common IT usage. The word “product”, often used to describe the same concept, has also become popular in Agile practice to reference development teams’ “code” delivery.
</p></div><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><div class="paragraph"><p>While acknowledging the ambiguity arising from choosing any of these terms, a single, simplified approach using one abstract unifying term, “Digital Product”, is used to clarify the intention of how the term “service” was used in previous IT4IT versions, and to consolidate the management aspects required for “application,” “service,” and “product” as described above.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The term “Digital Product” aligns well with recent trends and business semantics (such as those documented in DevOps and Agile practices and illustrated in IT management “Project to Product” directions and associated shifts in Financial Management), and with reorganizing the work of separate silos into single cross-functional teams.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Product Management disciplines have become a focus for traditional IT organizations, and in startup Digital Product teams that need to scale up as they grow. In both scenarios, the IT4IT Standard provides value. Product Management is a proven, mature competency with well established roles, activities, frameworks, lifecycle management approaches, and so on. Adopting “product” as the governing metaphor within the IT4IT Standard brings this acumen to the fore. The IT4IT Standard does not formally define the role of a Product Manager; instead we focus on defining Digital Product in the context of the main value streams, functional components, and data models required to manage them.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Standard is part of a solution set that supports Digital Transformation, connecting proven management practices with newer methods. For many successful organizations, Product Management and IT management roles will converge and unite into a new competency we call “Digital Product Management” a fundamental capability for managing digital.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="Digital_Product_definition">4.2. Digital Product Definition
</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>The Digital Product definition used in the IT4IT Standard highlights the distinction between Digital and non-Digital Products and provides clarity about the use of the term “digital” throughout the rest of the IT4IT Standard.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>This definition flows from widely accepted definitions of both “digital” and “product”, brought together to form a unique type of product that incorporates IT management. <a href="#Merriam-Webster">Merriam-Webster</a> defines <em>digital</em> as “characterized by electronics, especially computerized technology”.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><a href="https://cio-wiki.org/wiki/Product">The Business Dictionary</a> defines <em>product</em> as “a good or service that most closely meets the requirements of a particular market and yields enough profit to justify its continued existence”.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/product">The Economic Times</a> defines <em>product</em> in more detail as:
</p></div><div class="quoteblock"><blockquote><div class="paragraph"><p>“A product is the item offered for sale. A product can be a service or an item. It can be physical or in virtual or cyber form. Every product is made at a cost and each is sold at a price. The price that can be charged depends on the market, the quality, the marketing, and the segment that is targeted. Each product has a useful life after which it needs replacement, and a lifecycle after which it has to be re-invented.”
</p></div></blockquote></div><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><div class="paragraph"><p>A “Digital Product” can be defined as:
</p></div><div class="quoteblock"><blockquote><div class="paragraph"><p>“A service, physical item, or digital item that provides an agreed and specific outcome for a consumer; that incorporates and requires software to realize that outcome; that is expected to require active management of the software and its required resources over its lifecycle, in a manner prescribed by the provider; and that is described by a formal offer of the outcome to be provided in exchange for an explicit price.”
</p></div></blockquote></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The criteria of a Digital Product:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>A Digital Product <strong>must</strong> include one or more Service Offers which define Service Contract options for consumers
</p></li><li><p>A Digital Product <strong>may</strong> be delivered as a Digital Product Instance (defined below) as described in the Service Offer
</p></li><li><p>The Digital Product Instance <strong>may</strong> include a system containing IT, non-IT resources, and software
</p></li><li><p>A Digital Product <strong>may</strong> be consumed within an organization or externally
</p></li><li><p>A Digital Product <strong>may</strong> have dependencies on other Digital Products
</p></li><li><p>A Digital Product <strong>may</strong> be comprised of other Digital Products
</p></li><li><p>A Digital Product <strong>may</strong> be a resource for other Digital Products
</p></li><li><p>A Digital Product <strong>must</strong> provide interactions via machine and/or human interfaces
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>A Digital Product refers primarily to the perspective of a Product Manager and represents a complete product line over its lifetime, to include product variants, types and locations of consumers, annual and lifetime financial models, dependencies on other products and services, supplier relationships, capacity, service-level options, distribution models, pricing and usage rules, delivery and management of Digital Product Instances, and so on.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="system-def">4.2.1. System Definition
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>The system comprises those technology components of a Digital Product Instance that will be managed by the provider.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Software, compute, and networking hardware are the most common system resources integrated into Digital Products. This may include custom and externally sourced software that may change frequently through Agile processes.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The system recursively includes any supporting resources upon which the system relies, including other products. Resources might be as simple as a few intangible lines of code to be deployed on hosted infrastructure in the cloud, or might be comprised of a large and complex number of components.
</p></div><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="service-offer-def">4.2.2. Service Offer Definition
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>The Service Offer (sometimes shortened to Offer) describes possible Service Contract terms as perceived by the potential consumer of a Digital Product Instance. The Offer must include all the elements that will become part of the contract if the Offer is accepted.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Offer formalizes the value statement and contract terms for consumer/provider interactions. The promises articulated in the Service Offer are recorded in a Service Contract as part of the agreed criteria for how the system will be managed and supported throughout its lifecycle. Longer-term contracts may be defined as subscriptions that track ongoing consumption and billing.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Offer is derived from the Digital Product definition, which includes all available consumable variants, and all possible contract terms. A product may in theory provide as many unique Offers as there are prospective types of consumer.
</p></div><div id="fig-pricing-table" class="imageblock text-center"><div class="content"><img src="it4it/3.0/standard.singlepage/images/Service_Offers.png" alt="Service Offers" /></div><div class="title">Figure 10. Pricing Table
</div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>A consumer can either be a human or internal employee actor, a paying customer, or alternatively a machine actor such as another Digital Product. The structure of both the Offer and the Service Contract may vary significantly based on the type of actor involved, and how a particular product is to be consumed.
</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="contract-def">4.2.3. Contract Definition
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>When an Offer is accepted by a consumer, an Instance of the Digital Product is created in which the relationship between provider and consumer is captured in a contract based on the relevant Offer. The contract includes all the details required for financial recording, governance, measurement, charging, support, and servicing of the Digital Product Instance.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>A contract for a Digital Product may include a subscription that describes the ongoing usage rights for a consumer, with periodic charges.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>For example, a Wi-Fi network in a public place is made available to consumers. When a consumer logs on to the network using the credentials supplied by the network owner, a Digital Product Instance is created. The product is not the Wi-Fi network itself. The product is the provision of access to the network and its resources. This product incorporates other Digital Products including, at a minimum, the Wi-Fi router. The contract may be implicit or explicit, and will likely be governed by a range of legal and technical constraints, all of which form part of the contract.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>In its simplest form, a Service Contract may record a single transaction that is not normally expected to have recurring charges, usage charges, or to require support. However, even such a one-off transaction will typically include mutual commitments to rules and metrics about possible future circumstances governed by the contract terms, such as regulatory compliance, warranty, repair, refunds, Service-Level Agreements (SLAs), consumer support, product recalls, offers on related items, commitments to keep the software up-to-date, and so on.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The contract structure includes Offer terms as agreed upon for the Digital Product Instance. The interaction process described in the Consume value stream addresses all the concerns for this interaction with a consumer, to include the following:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Warranties and SLAs
</p></li><li><p>A record of the transactional commitments made by both parties
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>For a consumer Digital Product sold online, this may be an identifier for a series of web page interactions in which terms are accepted and money is taken. For an internal machine-to-machine contract, this may be the digital record of a “handshake” acknowledgement between two systems.

</p><div class="paragraph"><p>In the IT4IT Standard, this contract data forms the basis for managing chargeback/showback, and penalties for the breach of SLAs.

</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>Each Service Offer and Service Contract describes a price which may require direct payment by a consumer through the Chargeback Record and may include an ongoing subscription.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Price need not be related to cost and is merely relayed to the customer as showback. In some cases, the price may consist entirely of indirect benefits anticipated by the provider with no financial charge at all.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The element of chargeback and showback at a minimum is meaningful for effective reporting and Product Management. In every offering, a Product Manager should be able to describe the Return on Investment (ROI) over the product lifecycle. Offering a Digital Product Instance with no direct price should always be a deliberate pricing decision that is explained in the product’s lifetime financial model.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>In cases where the Digital Product is perceived by the consumer primarily as software, it will always include other components defined by the Digital Product Manager, including those required by the business or legal context of product delivery, as well as the provision of a supporting infrastructure.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>These other associated components – which may not be explicit in the Offer or Service Contract – may include hardware in which software is embedded (disk drive, smartphone, Internet of Things (IoT) doorbell, automobile). They may also include contractual elements (SLAs, chargeback terms, warranties, software maintenance commitments, customer support).

</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>In the IT4IT Reference Architecture, Version 2.1, the Service Model Backbone represents the full lifecycle of an IT service, which had previously included services from both a labor and a digital perspective. The Digital Product, however, changes this focus to address technology or code as the main actor in the delivery of an outcome of a service, removing those services performed by human labor.

</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="Examples_of_Digital_Products">4.4. Examples of Digital Products
</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>The examples listed here are consumer products that are easy to recognize. However, the majority of Digital Products are primarily designed to be incorporated within another product. When thinking about a Digital Product we need to recognize that the critical boundary of a product is what a supplier provides to the consumer.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="_ecommerce_websites">4.4.1. eCommerce Websites
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>A website that provides functionality for shoppers and vendors to reach a commercial agreement is a typical Digital Product. The consumer of this Digital Product would be the vendor’s Sales Department(s), not the shopper.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The eCommerce website may be comprised of several Digital Products. These may have different functionalities to support other users, such as those who maintain site data or manage financial transactions. The different functionality may also be different Digital Products.
</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="_mobile_applications">4.4.2. Mobile Applications
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>Mobile applications are Digital Products. Most are provided through a store managed by the digital platform provider. They may also be linked to other products, physical and digital. Fitness mobile applications typically require a separate physical device to track motion and location. Other mobile applications act as channels to Digital Products, such as a newspaper subscription or online banking.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Digital Products are often comprised of other Digital Products, or are dependent on other products to provide a complete outcome.
</p></div><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="_operational_technology">4.4.3. Operational Technology
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>Digital Products can also automate manufacturing, warehouses, or other activities outside of typical back-office applications. This more industrial and embedded use of automation technology is commonly known as Operational Technology (OT).
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>For example, applications are now typically used to manage wind farms, monitor and adjust factory equipment, create tasks for planned and unplanned maintenance, or change operational characteristics due to weather events and forecasts. There may be a network connection to support communications and software updates to be applied on an ongoing basis, much in the same way data centers are managed.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>In factory automation, there may be dozens or hundreds of smart OT devices with embedded computers, for which software may be updated periodically to update code and change configurations. The possibility of such a continuous improvement feedback loop means that software design can be more Agile and at the same time more complex than the design of traditional embedded systems, for which firmware updates may be expensive and complicated, or even impossible.
</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="Digital-Oven-Example">4.4.4. Smart Devices with Digital Interfaces
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>This is a rapidly growing category of internet-connected products ranging from smart watches to automobiles that combine a traditional physical product format with software to create Digital Products. These smart products do not contain only the physical device and its embedded software; the core product definition may also include cloud-based software and software running on other platforms, such as smartphones. For example:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>A digital oven that can be programmed by scanning a barcode on a food package using a mobile app, providing the oven with cooking instructions via a cloud-based cooking instruction look-up system; alerts can be sent to a smart watch to inform the user that cooking is complete
</p></li><li><p>A modern car, containing more lines of code than model desktop operating systems, for which updates are routinely pushed from the car manufacturer, and which can be monitored and controlled from miles away using a smartphone app
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>The product definition includes software in the car and the app, software elsewhere in the supporting ecosystem, and all the mechanisms needed to keep the software up to date.

</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>An important category of Digital Product is the digital platform. This product is designed to enable the creation or hosting of other Digital Products which can be sold or shared with consumers.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Common examples of how this works in practice include the app stores available to Apple<sup>®</sup> and Android™ customers, or the Azure<sup>®</sup> and Amazon Web Services™ platforms that provide a range of easily orderable plugins, and also the ability for users to create their own.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>There are many types of platforms that use the same model:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) raw compute and virtual compute
</p></li><li><p>Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms accessed in the cloud
</p></li><li><p>Low code/no code development
</p></li><li><p>Content platform, such as for music, videos, and documents
</p></li><li><p>Digital Services, such as connecting drivers, passengers, and deliveries
</p></li><li><p>Software applications that rely on shared platform capabilities, such as smartphones, TVs, and platforms built for Sales, Human Resources (HR), or IT Management
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Many digital platforms incorporate shared resources, such as platform-specific development tools, an integrated store for configuring or adding features through plugins, platform-dependent application management, self-service interactions for purchase, and knowledge and support features.
</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="_interplay_among_digital_products">4.4.6. Interplay Among Digital Products
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>The digital oven example in <a href="#Digital-Oven-Example">Section 4.4.4</a> illustrates an accelerating trend in which collaboration between interacting Digital Products adds greater value than when they function independently.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The oven example of an IoT-based product reflects marketing collaboration among multiple Product Managers of the oven, the watch app, the phone app, and the food-cooking instruction suppliers. All this functionality is embodied in software created by each company involved and supported by interoperability standards such as <em>O-DEF™, the Open Data Element Framework, Version 2.0, a standard of The Open Group</em> [<a href="#C202">C202</a>] and the <em>Open Messaging Interface (O-MI), The Open Group Standard for the Internet of Things (IoT), Version 2.0</em> [<a href="#C19E">C19E</a>]. The result is a value-added ecosystem which others can join – or from which competitors can be excluded.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>This interplay creates opportunities and data for all parties. The data and ongoing consumer feedback received helps the Digital Product Manager to make decisions such as adding features, improving performance, adjusting pricing models, and updating market strategies.
</p></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="_granularity_and_dependency_of_digital_products">4.5. Granularity and Dependency of Digital Products
</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>A Digital Product may be composed of, or relies upon, other Digital Products. For example:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>An app that offers room booking or transportation may rely on a cloud-based Digital Product providing mapping-as-a-service
</p></li><li><p>A web or mobile app-based streaming video service may rely on a separate platform of web service products to manage and provide streaming content
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The network of dependencies of interconnected Digital Products may be deep, and may form very complex systems.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Each component in the system may be another Digital Product. Each Interaction may have a Service Offer, though sometimes they are not well defined.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="_examples_of_digital_product_granularity">4.5.1. Examples of Digital Product Granularity
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>Consider an insurance policy (a type of Digital Product) that relies on software to calculate premium charges.
</p></div><div class="sidebarblock"><div class="content"><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Case A</strong><br />The insurance company uses a third-party software package and signs a license agreement allowing use of the software. The agreement is a contract for a Digital Product Instance and defines the exact details of how the insurance company can use the software, including pricing and payment terms. The contract will also include vendor guarantees of calculation accuracy and system performance, and may define penalties and liability for failures. Information about this contract should be easy to incorporate into the design of the insurance product to meet stipulations of compliance and audit, consumer needs, and warranty. The cost of the calculation system’s software license – as well as risk management for possible errors – will be a factor in setting valuation and pricing rules for the insurance “book” that represents the affected product line.
</p></div></div></div><div class="sidebarblock"><div class="content"><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Case B</strong><br />The software used to calculate premiums is created, managed, and supported by a separate in-house department. Is it a “product”? Should it still be managed as a Digital Product? If not, will there be the same confident understanding of long-term cost and risk for this software over the life of the insurance “book”? Does using in-house software make it any less important to track the cost of the calculations, to define and manage expected performance, or to analyze the risk and liability of incorrect calculations?

</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>Some Digital Products are expected to be shared and used broadly as components or dependencies in more complex Digital Products. Microservices architectures are a common example. For a Digital Product that is an “internal” sub-component or dependency of another Digital Product, some formalism in understanding pricing and contracts helps in three ways:
</p></div><div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li><p>It may create an objective basis for understanding financial outcomes and value for the sub-component products. Increased formalism and consequential measurement practices provide continuous visibility of the operational and financial data needed to support full lifecycle Product Management, providing the same level of insight and routine control provided by Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems or by cloud platform providers.
</p></li><li><p>It may provide the data collection processes needed to understand internal products by the same standards used for externally sourced products. This can result in a more objective comparison of options. In some cases, an internally sourced product may be a candidate external product in its own right. Alternatively, an apples-to-apples comparison of well-defined internal and external products could provide the case for replacing internal products with more viable external options.
</p></li><li><p>It may support long-term planning of the product lifecycle and the management of technology risks. Roadmapping and investment planning can become more proactive and long-term (as opposed to reactive and <em>ad hoc</em>). The use of automated reports can reveal concerns about the full stack of components such as end-of-life, security vulnerabilities, and compliance.

</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="_digital_product_lifecycle_concerns">4.10. Digital Product Lifecycle Concerns
</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>Digital Product Management must address two distinct lifecycle concerns that map to various IT4IT Value Streams (see <a href="#fig-product-lifecycle">Figure 15</a>):
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p><strong>System lifecycle</strong> (the managed IT component of the product)
</p></li><li><p><strong>Contract lifecycle</strong> (governs consumed instances, warranties, commitments, and dependent systems)
</p></li></ul></div><div id="fig-product-lifecycle" class="imageblock text-center"><div class="content"><img src="it4it/3.0/standard.singlepage/images/product-lifecycle.png" alt="product lifecycle" width="80%" /></div><div class="title">Figure 15. Digital Product Lifecycle Management
</div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The system lifecycle is a familiar concept in IT management. For example, an internal application system remains a subject of active concern for as long as it is in use.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>After such a system is decommissioned, we will quickly lose interest in most of the hardware and software. We still must address any residual data retention and disposal requirements, sometimes for many years. This is included in traditional understandings of technology lifecycles.
</p></div><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The contract lifecycle for a Digital Product may be more complex, especially regarding residual or implied lifecycle management concerns for external consumers or for a product that is a sub-unit of another product:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>The lifecycle of the contract depends on the existence and management of the system used by the consumer
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>The underlying system(s) should not be retired until all contractual obligations are met.
</p></div></li><li><p>The contract lifecycle concept depends partly on maintaining enough information and related capability to ensure that the contractual obligations for every consumer are fully discharged
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>As our societal understanding of digital rights evolves this may include obligations defined after the fact by legislation or court cases.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>When the provider ends a contract, thus ending support for the underlying system and explicit support or warranty obligations, terminated consumers may be unable to retrieve critical data, to migrate to alternative systems, or to maintain the system. In these situations, consumers have banded together to continue to support Digital Products long after support from the provider has ceased.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>For example, modern farming relies on Global Positioning System (GPS) modules supplied by tractor manufacturers that are used to ensure crops are planted or cultivated in straight rows. Data generated by the system has a financial value to the farmer. Ongoing updates and patches to the software are essential to ongoing product value.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Such a tractor is a Digital Product for which the contractual context can be murky, and this gives rise to litigation and pressure on legislatures about data ownership, rights to use the data, and the “right to repair”:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Can the manufacturer keep the GPS component design and code secret, so that no one else can service the product?
</p></li><li><p>Who owns the data created while the product is being used?
</p></li><li><p>What happens if the manufacturer discontinues support – can the farmer be forced to buy a new module or even a whole new tractor to stay in business?
</p></li><li><p>Can consumers who band together to continue to support Digital Products after support has ceased insist on being given enough information to be able to do so?
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The manager of a Digital Product must consider end-of-life scenarios such as these and provide consumers with suitable recourse in end-of-life situations. Managing contract risks such as the pressure for “right to repair” becomes part of the Product Management function.

</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>Until a system is retired, its underlying resources and dependencies must be managed until no active consumers depend on it and all instances have been retired, and possibly longer, depending on factors such as regulatory requirements for data retention.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>To maintain the operational integrity of a Digital Product, the code, hardware, third-party software (each has their own support lifecycle), and integrations must be managed. Often, dependencies have their own upgrade and maintenance cycles that should be tracked as well.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Digital Products rely on a supply chain that is often real-time: code-executed and data-driven functionality. The Digital Product Manager is accountable for ensuring that dependencies with other Digital Products are managed along with any contractual, financial, and technical requirements.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The rapid cycle time for changes in Digital Products requires a level of automation not needed for more traditional products. Many products receive software updates weekly or even daily. This can only be managed using an automated toolchain and support process. The IT4IT Standard describes how this can be done.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="_data_driven_opportunities_and_concerns">4.12. Data-Driven Opportunities and Concerns

Data can be collected from a wide range of sources to include the consumer, external sources, automatic capture through embedded sensors, or related Digital Products in complex systems. Insights for the consumer or Product Manager can be generated as data is analyzed to provide reports and recommendations, and to take proactive action.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>For effective full lifecycle management, policies and controls should be put in place to ensure the information created in the design, creation, management, and support of the Digital Product, and operational support of systems deployed to support Digital Product Instances remain available for a much longer period than is typical in a project-oriented investment model.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Data governance must be effectively applied across the full lifecycle of the product, including data retention management and compliance with privacy and other applicable policies.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The design, planning, source code, and other information created to define and manage the system should be retained for future planning and support purposes.

Typical Contractual Mesh Among Digital Products
</div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>When more elaborate Digital Product systems are deployed and connected using Service Management models such as ITIL<sup>®</sup>, some resources can be managed as Configuration Items (CIs), representing the system’s underlying and integrated resources. Each CI represents a device or software object (such as an executable file for an application, operating system, etc.) that is discoverable when active on the enterprise network, or that has been manually recorded.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>A Configuration Management Database (CMDB) is used by most large organizations to manage a subset of possible CIs that has been defined as interesting for management of the IT landscape. Discovery tools or manual data entry are used to capture and update CI information.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>More sophisticated CMDBs and CMDB users are able to aggregate individual CIs into a data set that represents more complex and interesting management objects, such as licensed software instances, in-house applications recognizable with a “signature”, etc. A challenge for Digital Product Management is to define the extent to which the Digital Product footprint can or should be recorded using an extended CMDB metamodel.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>For example, it may be sensible for each instance of a Digital Product found in the CMDB to include a foreign key pointing to the Subscription record created at instantiation, or to the consumer represented by that record. This or some other mechanism should enable system resources identified in the Configuration functional component to be traceable to those consumers, their Service Contracts, and Subscriptions.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>As suggested in <a href="#fig-digital-product-contract">Figure 19</a>, interaction among collaborating Digital Products, through Service Contracts and Subscriptions, pertains to both human and machine interfaces, entitlements, ownership, and access to systems.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Underlying code executes within interconnected systems to complete interactions for consumers, and may involve external suppliers as well.

They support a holistic lifecycle approach for the planning, creation, delivery, modification, operation, support, and retirement of a Digital Product, combining all of the necessary capabilities to deliver value and support to the dependent parts of the Digital Product lifecycle.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>There are seven value streams defined:

</div></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Overview</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The value stream “Evaluate”, as shown in <a href="#fig-evaluate_value_stream">Figure 21</a>, contributes to the business strategy and portfolio planning activities. It provides a blueprint for optimizing products, services, and investment Portfolio Management. This value stream is focused on the continuous assessment and evaluation of the entire Digital Product Portfolio to optimize co-creation and alignment of business and technology Strategic Objectives.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Many organizations have portfolio processes and solutions in place but suffer from the following limitations:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Poor data quality and consistency
</p></li><li><p>No holistic portfolio view across the enterprise
</p></li><li><p>Inconsistent Portfolio, Service, and Product Management
</p></li><li><p>Poor tracking and correlation of the product lifecycle
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Organizations need accurate and point-in-time information to understand the inter-relationships and inter-dependencies required to truly orchestrate all the moving parts of Digital Products in ways that can help support business objectives and goals.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Evaluate value stream provides holistic views of Product Portfolio activities. These views offer an understanding of the inter-relationships among many sub-domains, including Portfolio Management, Enterprise Architecture, Application Management, Information Management, Operations Management, and Information Security Management.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Evaluate value stream is triggered by a portfolio planning cycle. Portfolio planning can be done in weekly, monthly, or annual cycles.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The overall funding of a Digital Product consists of portfolio epic-based funding (often referred to as Grow the Business (GtB), or discretionary) and product specific investments (often referred to as Run the Business (RtB), or non-discretionary). The product-specific Scope Agreement is defined in the Design value stream and aligned with the prioritized portfolio level Scope Agreements. This funding methodology enables decentralized decision-making by the Product team.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Key Stakeholder</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The primary value stream stakeholder of the Evaluate value stream is the Product Portfolio Manager. The Product Portfolio Manager is responsible for ensuring consistent services and portfolio balance through rationalization and sound investments. The Product Portfolio Manager works closely with Strategists, Business Relationship Managers, Architects, and Technologists to align with strategic drivers, consumer demand, and policy standards. They must work together to optimize the portfolio through well-defined control points, data objects, and governance.
</p></div><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Value</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The outcome of the Evaluate value stream is a portfolio investment plan with funding and resources to conduct product exploration activities and refine the plan. Here, resources are referred as both IT-related resources such as IT infrastructure, database, software packages and non-IT-related resources such as HR, etc. This value stream delivers an optimized Product Portfolio with secure and quality Digital Products that are consumer friendly and cost effective, accomplished through continuous portfolio improvement and refinement.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Cross-Value Stream Dependencies</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Evaluate value stream depends on:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>All value streams:
</p><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>To continually bring in ideas, improvements, and demand to the Evaluate value stream
</p></li><li><p>To capture data that ensures the quality of the Digital Product will meet the requirements
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>Quality is an aspect of each task within each value stream. Quality data may also be used to help analyze the Portfolio Backlog.
</p></div></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Value streams that depend on the Evaluate value stream are:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>All value streams:
</p><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Improvements start with drivers that are expected to arise from all seven value streams

</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>The Evaluate value stream is applicable for the following four scenarios:
</p></div><div id="VSO_Consider-a-New-Digital-Product" class="paragraph"><p><strong>Consider a New Digital Product Scenario</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The trigger for this scenario is a business requirement for a new Digital Product. The outcome is a Scope Agreement and resource allocation focused on Portfolio Backlog Items and Strategic Objectives, indicating there is a strong business case for a new Digital Product. New Digital Products are often considered when a new technology is introduced in the marketplace that may solve a business problem; when technology becomes obsolete and needs to be modernized; or when a new business niche is desired.
</p></div><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><div id="VSO_Perform-Digital-Product-Governance" class="paragraph"><p><strong>Perform Digital Product Governance Scenario</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The trigger for this scenario is the Change Management of Digital Products. The outcome is a secure, quality, consumer-friendly, cost-effective Digital Product that aligns with Strategic Objectives, Architecture Principles, technology standards, and financial and policy constraints. Governance ensures the traceability of the Digital Product lifecycle information from Strategy to Development and into Operations.
</p></div><div id="VSO_Rationalize-the-Product-Portfolio" class="paragraph"><p><strong>Rationalize the Product Portfolio Scenario</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The trigger for this scenario is a business requirement to rationalize and balance the Digital Product Portfolio. The outcome is a Scope Agreement and resource allocation focused on Portfolio Backlog Items for the portfolio rationalization types: Retain, Replace, Re-Build, Retire. Based on the rationalization type a Digital Product is left as-is, substituted, modernized, or decommissioned. Rationalization is imperative to maintain a healthy and balanced portfolio by minimizing Digital Product technical debt and capability redundancy.
</p></div><div id="VSO_Plan-Product-Portfolio-Investments" class="paragraph"><p><strong>Plan Product Portfolio Investments Scenario</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The trigger for this scenario is a portfolio planning increment. A portfolio planning cycle can be in weekly, monthly, or annual increments. The Product Portfolio provides information about the health of existing Digital Products and new product strategy. This information supports decisions for investing or reinvesting in products and services. The outcome of a portfolio planning cycle is a Scope Agreement that provides the required scope and funding for portfolio-related concerns. Digital Product-specific concerns are delegated to a Product Manager and Digital Product stakeholders for refinement in the Design value stream. Big strategic initiatives and cross-product content are funded and governed at the portfolio level in the Evaluate value stream; while smaller product investments are better managed at the product level in the Design value stream.
</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="VSS_Gather-Influencers">5.1.2. Gather Influencers Stage
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>The purpose of the value stream stage “Gather Influencers” is to bring together inputs for a planning cycle. Typical inputs include: consumer demand, improvement ideas, new technology opportunities, technology lifecycle events (e.g., end-of-life), and any known policy (legal and regulatory demands) or budget constraints for the Digital Product Portfolio. Other inputs may include an internal and/or external environmental scan to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Discussion with the business is centered on Digital Product value delivery for consumers and corresponding policy requirements. The deliverable for this value stream stage is new or updated Strategic Themes and/or Strategic Objectives.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>An important part of this stage is to manage the strategic roadmap of the Digital Enterprise. Throughout the IT4IT Value Streams, this roadmap will be refined from the Strategic intent to the Architecture Roadmap to the Digital Product Roadmap to the Release Roadmap.

</div></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Overview</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The value stream “Design”, as shown in <a href="#fig-explore_value_stream">Figure 23</a>, is performed on the Scope Agreements developed in the Evaluate value stream. It ensures that all planned and accepted Portfolio Backlog Items are further detailed, budgeted, and sourced for Digital Products. This value stream continuously explores new features and/or future directions of a Digital Product aligned with strategic direction and business needs. It ensures that the Product Design evolves to facilitate innovation and optimize business outcomes.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Digital Product Portfolio Backlog Items for investigating a new idea, optimizing existing ideas, or retirement may be resolved by different funding, management, reporting, and contractual obligations for various types of consumers. Differences in budgeting, technology, contracts, business domains, security, or organizational/management structures will influence the portfolios required for an organization.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Design value stream is intended to be executed in quick cycles to validate release iterations. The Portfolio Backlog Items should include the generation of a proof-of-concept, conceptual service, or Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with the high-level architectural attributes and activities to begin gathering requirements for the build stage.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Design value stream stage ensures that the allocation of resources, budget, and phases for Digital Product releases remain aligned with agreed, planned, and accepted Portfolio Backlog Items and Architecture Blueprints. The primary stakeholder of this value stream is a Product Manager who approves Scope Agreements and release plans for Digital Products.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>This value stream can be triggered by a changed Scope Agreement.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Key Stakeholder</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The primary value stream stakeholder of the Design value stream is the Product Manager. The Product Manager is responsible for the development and success of a Digital Product for an organization. Product Managers own the business strategy, manage the requirements, and launch features for a product. The Product Manager coordinates the work done by other functions, including: Business Relationship Manager, Architect, Strategist, Technologist, Business Owners, and DevSecOps.
</p></div><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Value</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The outcome of the Design value stream is an accepted and planned Product Backlog with a detailed Scope Agreement, Release Roadmap, and resource allocation.

</p></div><div id="VSO_Investigate-a-New-Digital-Product-Idea" class="paragraph"><p><strong>Investigate a New Digital Product Idea Scenario</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The trigger for this scenario is a Scope Agreement and an initial budget allocation to invest in a new Digital Product idea or enhancement that has a strong value proposition and alignment to one or more Strategic Objectives. The outcome is validation that the new product idea has a strong value proposition, alignment to one or more Strategic Themes, and will comply with technology standards and policy. The scope incorporates Portfolio Backlog Items for testing assumptions that may include a proof-of-concept, conceptual service, or an MVP to prove that consumer needs and problems can be addressed. Results retrieved from the proof-of-concept may lead to the refinement of Portfolio Backlog Items to continue researching the new product idea, or may result in a decision to reconsider, or rethink, a decision, and the reallocation or discontinuation of further investments and resources. This scenario may only be intended to validate a hypothesis and may not include the full operationalization of a Digital Product (for example, its inclusion in the Service Offer Catalog, automation using the Operate functions, or marketing it to consumers).
</p></div><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><div id="VSO_Optimize-a-Digital-Product" class="paragraph"><p><strong>Optimize a Digital Product Scenario</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The trigger for this scenario is a Scope Agreement and an initial budget allocation that incorporates Portfolio Backlog Items for optimizing a Digital Product. The outcome is an enhanced Digital Product. The scope includes activities to optimize a Digital Product based on innovating new features and addressing Defects, mandates, and technical debt. The outcome is a Scope Agreement and resource allocation priority focused on Portfolio Backlog Items for implementing a release for an existing Digital Product. The scope includes the creation of an MVP/Minimum Marketable Product (MMP) release together with testing assumptions about the business model. Results retrieved from the MVP may result in a decision to continue and refine, to pivot and reallocate, or to discontinue further investments and resources. This may lead to a request to increase or decrease investment, a change to resource allocation, a change in scope, or a change in timeline. An MVP may only include quick enhancements to Digital Products, as small changes, resulting in immediate business value (time, resources, and scope).
</p></div><div id="VSO_Refine-Digital-Product-Feasibility" class="paragraph"><p><strong>Refine Digital Product Feasibility Scenario</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The trigger for this scenario is a portfolio level Scope Agreement with a decision to invest in a new or existing product. Product planning cycles are conducted to further detail the budget, resource allocation, and feasibility for planned and accepted Portfolio Backlog Items. The outcome is a product level Scope Agreement that further details the scope and budget for a Product Design and the optimization of business outcomes. While big strategic initiatives and cross-product content are funded and governed on the portfolio level in the Evaluate value stream; smaller product investments are better managed at the product level by the Product team in the Design value stream.
</p></div><div id="VSO_Retire-Digital-Product" class="paragraph"><p><strong>Retire Digital Product Scenario</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The trigger for this scenario is a Scope Agreement and an initial budget allocation that incorporates Portfolio Backlog Items for retiring a Digital Product. The outcome is a decommissioned Digital Product. The scope includes activities to mitigate negative effects on consumers, impacts to dependencies, the re-allocation of resources, and the archival of data. Reasons for retirement may be driven based on technology debt, cost, duplication in the environment, lack of interest or use, or other valid reasons to no longer maintain a Digital Product. It is important to retire Digital Products that are no longer in use to reduce the complexity of technical environments.
</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="VSS_Prioritize-Backlog-Items">5.2.2. Prioritize Backlog Items Stage
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>The purpose of the value stream stage “Prioritize Backlog Items” is to refine qualified Portfolio Backlog Items and mandates for new or existing Digital Product investment decisions. The budget allocated in the Evaluate value stream for the Product Portfolio is used to explore Digital Product ideas and determine feasibility. This should include ensuring that scoped Product Backlog Items deliver value, mitigate risks, and meet governance criteria (technology, security, reliability, supportability, etc.). The deliverables for this value stream stage are a Scope Agreement with prioritized Product Backlog Items; scope and timing refined.

</div></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Overview</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The value stream “Construct”, as shown in <a href="#fig-integrate_value_stream">Figure 25</a>, creates a new Product Release. It covers the planning, design, development (or configuration), and testing of a new Product Release (in non-production environments), and makes the Product Release available for deployment and release into production. A new Product Release can also be related to an emergency fix needed to resolve a production issue (such as resolving vulnerabilities and critical bugs).
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Construct value stream covers the creation and modification of all types of Digital Products such as custom-build software, configuration of SaaS applications, Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software packages, PaaS platforms, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) products, etc. This value stream is not limited to application development, but also subject to the development and maintenance of infrastructure products (and platforms).
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Work is initiated and managed in the Product Backlog (and related team backlogs), which can receive demand signals from consumer or business stakeholders (e.g., new features or business requirements), or from other functional components such as Portfolio Backlog Management, Policy Management, and Problem Management. This may take the form of an approved Portfolio Backlog Item, or may be a smaller-grained signal such as an individual feature, user story, Defect, or Problem.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Construct value stream continuously pulls work from the Product Backlog based upon various triggers and inputs; such as:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>New features and requirements raised by a consumer (or a business stakeholder) and/or other product teams
</p></li><li><p>New or modified non-functional requirements such as those related to Service-Level Objectives (SLOs), security, risk, and compliance
</p></li><li><p>New portfolio epics from the portfolio backlog which need to be refined into Product Backlog Items
</p></li><li><p>New versions, updates, or fixes provided by the vendor (e.g., software updates and patches) and/or other technology refresh activities
</p></li><li><p>Problems detected in operational environments (e.g., functional issues, performance issues, etc.)
</p></li><li><p>Emergency changes to resolve major incidents and/or mitigate major risks (e.g., security issues and vulnerabilities)
</p></li></ul></div><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Construct value stream delivers the Product Release (for a new or modified product) which is packaged for immediate or future deployment through the Deploy value stream.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Note that although the stage is shown as a linear process, the actual work in the value stream consists of multiple iterations, continuous cycles, and flow of work with feedback loops (e.g., Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and continuous testing, etc.).
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Key Stakeholder(s)</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The typical key stakeholders involved in the Construct value stream are the Product Manager and associated Development Teams (also referred to as Product Teams, or DevOps Teams if Development and Operations are combined into one team), responsible for the planning, design, creation, and testing of a Product Release.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Other key stakeholders involved are business stakeholders and customer representatives involved in defining business needs (voice of the customer), validating (and testing) the product, and those who ultimately benefit from the value created by using the product.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Value</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The outcome of the Construct value stream is a new Product Release, accepted and ready for deployment and release into production. This is a release for a new or existing Digital Product which provides additional value (and/or reduced risk) once made available and used by consumers in production, as a result of:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>New features (e.g., providing additional value by fulfilling new consumer needs)
</p></li><li><p>Non-functional improvements (e.g., improving performance, improve user experience, compliance, security, availability, improved resilience, etc.)
</p></li><li><p>Reducing technology debt (and reducing risks), such as those related to technology upgrades/patches and code quality improvements
</p></li><li><p>Resolving issues/problems (e.g., improve reliability, reduce Incidents in production, improve performance, etc.)
</p></li><li><p>Reduce costs (e.g., improve utilization of resources, etc.)
</p></li></ul></div><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Cross-Value Stream Dependencies</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Construct value stream depends on:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Design:
</p><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Delivers Portfolio Backlog Items and an approved Scope Agreement to start creating or updating the Product Backlog
</p></li><li><p>If the agreed Scope Agreement cannot be met, the Design value stream is responsible for changing the Scope Agreement within the boundaries of the Architecture Roadmap and Product Portfolio; for example, to allocate more time or a higher budget
</p></li><li><p>Delivers an updated product vision and high-level roadmap
</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Consume:
</p><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Deliver the environments to work on, as a request can be used to fulfill the provisioning of a needed development, test, and staging environment
</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Deploy:
</p><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Deployment of the Product Release into a production environment
</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Operate:
</p><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Delivers an inflow for Defects, as Problems related to Actual Product Instances may require a fix (or patch) to be created through the Construct value stream
</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Value streams that depend on the Construct value stream are:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Evaluate:
</p><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>The Evaluate value stream uses all lifecycle information from all value streams to identify potential improvements in the product (and/or way of working)
</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Design:
</p><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Provides development progress and team capacity
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>The status of the Product Backlog Item is fed back so it can be taken into account when planning the Portfolio Backlog Items for sourcing.
</p></div></li><li><p>If an agreed Scope Agreement cannot be met, the Design value stream is responsible for changing the Scope Agreement; for example, by changing the covered Portfolio Backlog Items (to include more or go for less), changing the time or budget, or changing the sourcing party
</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Deploy:
</p><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Provides the approved Product Release, which in turn triggers the deployment scheduling of the Product Release to the production environment
</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Release:
</p><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Due to a new Product Release, one or more Service Offers need to be modified (or created) to make the new Product Release available for consumption
</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Operate:
</p><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>The Operate value stream depends upon the development of operations features, such as monitoring (and observability), logging, and automated remediation Runbooks
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>The Construct value stream needs to develop the required functionality to manage the product in an operational environment.

</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>The Construct value stream is applicable for the following four scenarios:
</p></div><div id="VSO_Develop-a-New-or-Initial-Product-Release" class="paragraph"><p><strong>Develop a New or Initial Product Release Scenario</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>In this scenario a Product Release is developed which may be software and/or infrastructure and is developed in-house or (partly) sourced with an external partner. The approach may either be traditionally waterfall or iterative, which would imply that iterations have taken place inside the Design &amp; Develop value stream stage.
</p></div><div id="VSO_Configure-an-Off-the-Shelf-or-SaaS-Product-for-Use" class="paragraph"><p><strong>Configure an Off-the-Shelf or SaaS Product for Use Scenario</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Off-the-Shelf applications and SaaS solutions need to be integrated in a business Value Stream and supporting infrastructure environments, which might include the configuration of the application software. The Scope Agreement contains the mandate to contract the software or SaaS solution with the vendor and configure the product to fit in the specific business Value Stream and supporting infrastructure.
</p></div><div id="VSO_Deliver-an-Emergency-Change-or-Hotfix" class="paragraph"><p><strong>Deliver an Emergency Change or Hotfix Scenario</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Construct value stream can be triggered by the Operate value stream in case a Defect needs to be created. The Build Package of the Digital Product in Operations is changed to fix the Defect, after which a new Product Release is delivered. It will be investigated whether this fix also needs to be applied (backported) to the newest Product Release under development (to prevent regression issues).
</p></div><div id="VSO_Update-of-a-Vendor-Product" class="paragraph"><p><strong>Update of a Vendor Product Scenario</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>A Digital Product can be based upon multiple third-party services and software components (packaged-based software, SaaS, PaaS, etc.). The Construct value stream should therefore also cover the technology refresh of new releases delivered by the software vendor and/or the SaaS service provider. It is important to include these technology lifecycle events into the Product Backlog so they can be planned and executed accordingly.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>A new release of the vendor product could, for example, include new features, patches/fixes for problems, or vulnerabilities and performance improvements. Changes from the vendor need to be integrated into the product build and release of the Digital Product, and tested to ensure the updates are successfully applied.

</div></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Overview</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The value stream “Deploy”, as shown in <a href="#fig-deploy_value_stream">Figure 27</a>, is installing a Product Release into production. It can also imply the removal, disposal, or updating of an existing installed Product Release, so it is made available or unavailable to the customer. Many possible strategies for deploying a Product Release can be scenarios within the Deploy value stream; for example, deployment to a targeted audience, or deployment using a dark launch in which functionality is not directly released to consumers. If the user requirements and/or the characteristics of the Digital Product demand that the installed Product Release is improved, released, and deployed frequently, a drive to automate these value streams can emerge. To comply with regulatory requirements, organizations can require approvals and an audit trail of all the Changes made in production environments. The Deploy value stream ensures that all changes are tracked and related to a specific Product Release.
</p></div><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Deploy value stream delivers the initial deployment, update, or removal of an Actual Product Instance, and will put the Service Contract into operation.

</p></div><div id="VSO_Deploy-a-First-Product-Release-for-a-New-Digital-Product" class="paragraph"><p><strong>Deploy a First Product Release for a New Digital Product Scenario</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The goal of this scenario is to plan, prepare, and execute the deployment of the initial version of the Digital Product. Part of the planning is determining the priority, assessing the risk and dependencies, and scheduling the time slot. The information used for the risk assessment will be limited as this is the first release of the Digital Product. However, during development, information from earlier deployments in non-production environments should provide the necessary information to minimize risk. Since no customer is using the Digital Product, available time slots might include office hours. The available capacity for dependent Digital Products can be checked, and IT assets requested if needed. The deployment schedule must consider any dependencies on the Orders required to allocate the necessary Resources.
</p></div><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><div class="paragraph"><p>During execution of the deployment, the Service Contract will be activated; this requires instrumentation of the data for the metrics that will be collected to measure the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) targets. Additional training of specialists involved in the Operate value stream are performed, although it is advisable to train specialists before the Product Release is finalized. Knowledge Items are created based on the Defects and test results (e.g., metrics from performance tests).
</p></div><div id="VSO_Deploy-a-New-Product-Release-Version-for-a-Digital-Product" class="paragraph"><p><strong>Deploy a New Product Release Version for a Digital Product Scenario</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The goal of this scenario is to plan, prepare, and update the existing Actual Product Instances. This ensures a stable Product Instance after the Deploy value stream is completed. The deployment strategy may depend on the Digital Product: some might require a maintenance window in which deployment can be executed, while for others a completely new version will be installed alongside an existing version. As every deployment should result in a stable Product Instance in production, there are some points to address:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>To mitigate risk, the plan should include a “point of no return” in time, and a “rollback to the last known good configuration” plan
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>These should be addressed and practiced during the development of the Product Release.
</p></div></li><li><p>During the execution of the deployment, stakeholders should be informed; for example, the monitoring events can be suppressed to prevent disrupting the Operate value stream
</p></li></ul></div><div id="VSO_Disable-or-Remove-Existing-Product-Release-Instances-of-a-Digital-Product" class="paragraph"><p><strong>Disable or Remove Existing Product Release Instances of a Digital Product Scenario</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The goal of this scenario is to completely or partly disable or remove Actual Product Instances of a Digital Product. The deployment design (which is part of the Product Release) should provide information on the active Product Release that needs to be removed or undeployed, whereas the Operate value stream has the actual information on which related Actual Product Instances are to be disabled or removed.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Removing a Digital Product might require changes to the Product Design, and, in some cases, customer data may have to be retained for a while and made available for the customer to view. Some of the components of the Digital Product can be removed, but new components may also be installed or deployed.

</div></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Overview</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The value stream “Release”, as shown in <a href="#fig-release_value_stream">Figure 29</a>, ensures that the Service Offers for ordering a new, a change in, or the decommissioning of an Actual Product Instance or its support to them are offered to consumers. The Release value stream maintains the Service Offer Catalog, the catalog views, and the Service Offer promotion and information of available Service Offers to the consumer base so that the individual consumer can find and order Digital Products, or support for them. Service Offers should be made available for viewing and requests for access over multiple channels. This value stream publishes the Service Offers based on various triggers and inputs, such as:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>The Product Release, as a result of the Construct value stream
</p></li><li><p>The decision of the Product Manager to provide a new (bundled) Service Offer based on existing Service Offers and releases
</p></li><li><p>The decision to change or terminate an existing Offer
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Release value stream delivers a digital service by means of a Service Offer that is made available and can be requested.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Key Stakeholder</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The primary stakeholder of the Release value stream is the Catalog Manager, who is primarily responsible for defining, implementing, and publishing the Service Offers so that they are available to be consumed by the target consumers.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Value</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The outcome of the Release value stream is to ensure the management of the consumable Service Offers for the Digital Product. These Service Offers are for new service consumption; there are Service Offers for support or to change/retire an Actual Product Instance. This also provides the following additional value to the consumers but is not limited to:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Centralization of the catalog (e.g., providing access control to all the products and services being offered to the consumers)
</p></li><li><p>Enabling self-service (e.g., the aggregated Service Offer Catalog facilitates user self-service capabilities by providing detailed information about the Service Offer Catalog item and its detailed attributes)
</p></li><li><p>Providing traceability (e.g., the Service Offer Catalog allows traceability of service, from ordering to fulfillment of the service)
</p></li><li><p>Reducing cost (e.g., the Service Offer Catalog reduces the time that the consumer requires from ordering to fulfillment of the service)

The following activities are part of this scenario:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Link the Service Offer to existing (via deploy/deployed) support/fulfillment plan(s); this includes linkage of the Service Offer to its internal and external support or fulfillment parties

</p></li></ul></div><div id="VSO_Change-an-Existing-Service-Offer" class="paragraph"><p><strong>Change an Existing Service Offer Scenario</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The outcome of this scenario is to maintain an up-to-date Service Offer for the consumers. The reason for the change of the Service Offer can vary. Recurring Change activities are:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Change of charged service price; e.g., annual service fee recalculation
</p></li><li><p>Change of underlying terms and conditions; e.g., when the SLA changes
</p></li><li><p>Change of the fulfillment or support plan; e.g., to include more automation

Activities in this scenario are:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Marketing and promotion of the termination of the Service Offer; this could include promotion to, for example, a new or replacement Product Release

The scenario ends with the outcome that the service remains operational without affecting consumer experience and within the boundaries of the Service Contract.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The activities undertaken in the scenario include the detection, diagnosis, evaluation, and resolution of issues, alerts, and anomalies related to the performance, compliance, and security aspects of the organization’s back-end.
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Performance remediation examples include: “reactive” event detection and correlation through the monitoring of the Digital Product Instance, system, and topology; “pro-active” event detection, through periodic service restarts, test transactions, or built-in self-healing capabilities; or “predictive” event detection, done by generating test events from the analysis of historical monitoring data and other data sources (e.g., business performance, social media, weather, etc.) to identify potential degradation based on predicted consumer behavior
</p></li><li><p>Security remediation examples include responses to different types of attack, including unauthorized system access, phishing, password cracking, spyware, malware, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, and more
</p></li><li><p>Compliance remediation examples include inspections to detect compliance with the rules; for example, adherence to legislation, statutes, regulations, standards, policies, contracts, processes, procedures, and operational controls
</p></li></ul></div><div id="VSO_Ensure-Disaster-Recovery-Objectives" class="paragraph"><p><strong>Ensure Disaster Recovery Objectives Scenario</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>This scenario is about ensuring that any capabilities listed in the business continuity/disaster recovery plan can work within the boundaries of the Service Contract. The activities in this scenario, which are planned and triggered by the business continuity and/or disaster recovery plan activities calendar, include: detection, diagnosis, and remediation tasks related to the plan. The purpose of the activities is to ensure that recovery objectives (e.g., Maximum Acceptable Outage (MAO), Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)) remain within the boundaries of the agreed Service Contract and BIA. Real-world examples of these activities include performing backups, ensuring plans and mechanisms for graceful degradation, removing Single Points Of Failure (SPOFs), validating recovery libraries, performing redundancy validations, testing backup sites, and performing running (scheduled or random) disaster recovery simulations.

</div></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Description</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Strategy to Portfolio functions, informally referred to as “Plan”, provide a framework for interconnecting the functions and data involved in managing a portfolio of Digital Products, enabling effective prioritization of proposed investments. The IT4IT approach replaces project-based IT investment practices in which unfiltered user demands often trigger suboptimal projects and most investment is for run costs that cannot be allocated to any particular user outcome.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Digital Product data object is the business description of a Digital Product and lies at the heart of Strategy to Portfolio functions. It records financial and operational outcomes, both as planned and as monitored.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Product Portfolio manages this data over the lifecycle of the Digital Product. Strategy to Portfolio functions manage the data governance, consistency, flows, and integrations needed to assure that Digital Product definitions are complete, robust, and actionable, and that they remain aligned and traceable to the organization’s Strategies, Policies and Roadmaps.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Strategy to Portfolio functions enable the filtering and rationalization of demand signals into consistently defined Portfolio Backlog Items associated with new or updated Digital Product definitions.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Evaluation of proposals to implement specific sets of Portfolio Backlog Items packaged with appropriate funding are formulated as Scope Agreements. Decision-makers can easily compare and prioritize these because Strategy to Portfolio functions enforce consistent data structures as well as traceability to Strategy and Policy value drivers. The Proposal function records these Scope Agreements and manages them over the life of the affected Digital Product(s).
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The information created and managed by the Strategy to Portfolio functions enables the effective design, creation, traceability, and management of strategy-aligned Product Releases by the Requirement to Deploy functions over the life of each Digital Product.

The Product Backlog Items (e.g., feature, business requirement, non-functional) are abstractions of implementation tasks. They may originate as a Requirement, Portfolio Backlog Item, Policy, or Problem; or may arise directly within the implementation team during solution development work. Regardless of methodology, the Requirement to Deploy functional components and data objects remain constant.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Requirement to Deploy functions contain the following functional components:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Develop functionality:
</p><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Product Backlog component
</p></li><li><p>Requirement component
</p></li><li><p>Product Design component
</p></li><li><p>Source Control component
</p></li><li><p>Pipeline component
</p></li><li><p>Build Package component
</p></li><li><p>Release Composition component
</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Test functionality:
</p><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Test component
</p></li><li><p>Defect component
</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Related Value Streams</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The following value streams use one or more functional components from the Requirement to Deploy functions:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Construct
</p></li><li><p>Release
</p></li><li><p>Deploy
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Business Benefits</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Requirement to Deploy functions describe a prescriptive framework of required functional components, integrations and data objects so organizations can deliver better value, sooner, and safer with lower costs while improving the productivity of the product teams.
</p></div><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The key benefits of using the Requirement to Deploy functions are:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Reduced lead time of delivering Product Backlog Items (e.g., new features or resolving Defects or Problems)
</p></li><li><p>Increased deployment frequency of new Product Releases
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>By using the same automatable architecture across teams (and by implication, standardized tools for the most automatable parts of the development and release chains), release frequency can be made more predictable and manageable. By ensuring that the Product Release includes all the content needed for automated instantiation, the Requirement to Deploy functional and data models provide an architecture able to decrease the time from committed code to live systems to zero.
</p></div></li><li><p>More complete and more traceable testing capability, which should result in higher change success rates and reduced security risks
</p></li><li><p>End-to-end transparency and traceability from requirement and/or backlog item to Product Release
</p></li><li><p>Reduced risk due to Security and Compliance by Design
</p><div class="paragraph"><p>The Requirement to Deploy functions maintain the association between Policy and Requirement data objects throughout the product lifecycle. This persistent traceability enables designers to ensure that all non-functional requirements are accounted for, so that products are designed in accordance with standards and policies from sources such as Security Management, Governance, Risk, &amp; Compliance, Legal &amp; Regulatory, Enterprise Architecture, and Financial Management.
</p></div></li><li><p>Improved interoperability, communication, and collaboration among involved stakeholders and teams (including external vendors)
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Applications and services may be sourced or developed in cooperation with many different parties, all of which work with their own processes and tooling. The Requirement to Deploy functional criteria define a standard for interoperability that enables digital organizations to enforce a consistent, standardized description of planned activities and interoperability of functions and data.
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Standardized product development and delivery to the point where the reuse of service components is the norm
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Requirement to Deploy functions enable the creation of consistently defined libraries of reusable artifacts by prescribing how to manage Requirements, Source, documentation, test scripts, Service Monitors, and other artifacts of the service development lifecycle as standardized data objects. The explicitly defined interfaces of the Requirement to Deploy functions means that access to such libraries can be extended across multiple organizations and locations. When access to these libraries is integrated with implementation tools such as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), and supported by management direction, a dramatic increase in reuse becomes a realistic goal.
</p></div><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Accelerate the sourcing and delivery of products and services through best practices such as:
</p><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Reuse – manage, maintain, and leverage reusable components and services
</p></li><li><p>Automation – identify the core functional components and data required to streamline the Construct value stream
</p></li><li><p>Collaboration – use data to institutionalize collaboration of teams involved in the development lifecycle

Request to Fulfill Functions Model
</div></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Description</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Request to Fulfill functions, informally referred to as "Deliver", represent a modern, consumption-driven engagement model that goes beyond the traditional service request management. It is a framework for connecting various consumers (business users, technology practitioners, or end customers) with the goods and services that they need to drive productivity and innovation. It fosters service consumption and fulfillment, service costing, knowledge sharing, self-service support, and collaboration between communities of interest to improve the overall engagement experience with IT. Many organizations use multiple technology services and/or service catalogs to address the needs of their consumers. The Request to Fulfill functions bring these different catalogs and consumer personas into a single consumption experience, thereby eliminating complexity and confusion for consumers in browsing through multiple service catalogs to choose what services they need.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Request to Fulfill functions contain the following functional components:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Consume functionality:
</p><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Consumption Experience component
</p></li><li><p>Identity Management component
</p></li><li><p>Offer Management component
</p></li><li><p>Order component
</p></li><li><p>Chargeback component
</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Fulfill functionality:
</p><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Change component
</p></li><li><p>Fulfillment Orchestration component
</p></li><li><p>Resource component
</p></li><li><p>Fulfillment component
</p></li><li><p>Usage component
</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>One of the main objectives of the Request to Fulfill functions is to drive the system of engagement by facilitating a unified engagement framework between consumers and the other related IT4IT Functional Components. Below are some of the system of engagement key goals:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Drive the consumption through the unified aggregated catalog
</p></li><li><p>Enable collaboration between communities of interest
</p></li><li><p>Obtain support through a self-service interface
</p></li><li><p>Access knowledge that enables them to be better informed about services offered by IT
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Related Value Streams</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The following value streams use one or more functional components from the Request to Fulfill functions:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Release
</p></li><li><p>Consume
</p></li><li><p>Deploy
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Business Benefits</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Request to Fulfill functions place emphasis on time-to-value, repeatability, and consistency for consumers looking to request and obtain services from IT. It optimizes both service consumption and fulfillment experiences by delineating between the creation of offers and catalog aggregation. The Request to Fulfill functions enable the aggregation of catalogs and Service Offers from multiple service providers into a single consumption experience. Therefore, while there is complexity on the delivery side in managing the various catalogs and Service Offers, it is not exposed to the consumer and the ordering experience is seamless and inviting. This also enables effective chargeback and service costing mechanisms, a key requirement in a multi-sourcing environment.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The key benefits of using the Request to Fulfill functions are:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Provides a blueprint for increasing business innovation velocity by facilitating a service Consumption Experience that allows consumers to easily find and subscribe to goods and services through a self-service engagement model
</p></li><li><p>Provides a functional framework that delineates between a single Service Offer Catalog and Identity Management and Consumption Experience portal to reduce complexity in the consumer experience
</p></li><li><p>Provides an architectural foundation for moving from traditional request management to service brokerage that increases both business and effectiveness
</p></li><li><p>Increased fulfillment efficiency and consistency through standard change deployment and automation
</p></li><li><p>Provides holistic visibility and traceability across the service subscription, usage, and chargeback to improve Financial Management
</p></li><li><p>Enables increased cost optimization; for example, by canceling expired Subscriptions and reclaiming resources, Subscriptions, and/or licenses that are unused

Self-service concepts are used to limit the interaction flow to people and provide direct remediation, thereby enhancing customer experience.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The Consumption Experience functional component also embraces Customer Journey Mapping; typically the path followed by a consumer when they interact with the Consumption Experience portal. It includes every touchpoint the consumer might run into throughout their interactions with IT, which helps in creating the overall self-service functionality in the Consumer Experience portal that drives improved customer experience.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>This provides an interface supported across multiple devices such as smartphones, tablets, etc. and also a plug-and-play connectivity for components that need to be exposed through the portal.

It builds and publishes the various offerings into Service Offer Catalogs for populations to consume, and to determine prices and valid options that consumers can select. It enables Service Offers to be grouped into a single Service Offer Catalog to expose them as a collection of consumable items for a given group of consumers. It ensures all required information is captured for the fulfillment (deployment/delivery) of the service from the Offer template of the Release Composition functional component. It fulfills each Service Offer through numerous underlying Offer templates as determined by this functional component. The offerings typically include the approval mechanisms needed for their fulfillment.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Based on the risk profile of the service offer, it also defines whether the fulfillment is needed to be routed through the Change Management process or directly goes for the fulfillment.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>For example, Service Offers such as User ID creation, access rights, laptop requests, etc. may lead to creating service Request Orders and such order requests shall be directed for fulfillment without the Change Management process. However, Service Offers such as server migration, application releases, etc. may lead to creating Change Orders that go through the Change Management process.

</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>This section formally defines all the concepts of the IT4IT Standard, which includes the IT4IT Metamodel.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Standard uses the ArchiMate modeling language, and thus the IT4IT Metamodel is defined as an IT4IT solution pattern in the ArchiMate language. This consists of the IT4IT Reference Architecture as a model specified in the ArchiMate language, which can be exchanged using the <em>ArchiMate<sup>®</sup> Model Exchange File Format for the ArchiMate Modeling Language, Version 3.1</em> [<a href="#C19C">C19C</a>].
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Standard is complemented with a simplified notation that makes it easier to communicate the high-level concepts of the IT4IT Standard to people not familiar with the ArchiMate language. Note that the simplified notation has a direct translation into the ArchiMate representation, and thus is as formal as the ArchiMate representation.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Most of the terminology used in the architecture is based on or derived from existing industry standard taxonomies. The architecture does introduce some new terms but this is only done when no other existing term could be utilized to express the intended meaning of the concept.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Note that the following definitions are ordered to reflect a hierarchy of refinement level as introduced in <a href="#IT4IT-abstractions">Section 11.2</a>.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Refer to <a href="#Acronyms-and-Abbreviations">Appendix B</a> for an alphabetic list of acronyms and abbreviations used in this document.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="_it4it_metamodel">11.1. IT4IT Metamodel
</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Standard introduces ten normative concepts as well as a number of complementary non-normative concepts. Their names and relations are pictured in <a href="#fig-IT4IT-metamodel">Figure 75</a>.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The number associated with each concept indicates at which abstraction level of the IT4IT Standard the concept is introduced. Some concepts are introduced at a high abstraction level but only formally defined further down; this is indicated by one or two numbers in the metamodel objects; see <a href="#IT4IT-abstractions">Section 11.2</a> for details.

</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Reference Architecture is communicated using multiple levels of abstraction, which is inspired by a similar approach employed by the eTOM<sup>®</sup> frameworks from the TM Forum. Each abstraction level expands on the previous level to expose more details and prescriptive guidance. The upper levels are vendor and implementation independent and provide generic views that are suitable for strategy and planning purposes as well as for creating roadmaps for implementing the IT4IT Reference Architecture. The lower levels provide specific details, ultimately arriving at implementation level or vendor-owned/controlled information. Content at these levels is suitable for developing implementation plans and for facilitating Product Design. The IT4IT Reference Architecture introduces five abstraction levels and standardizes the first three, as shown in <a href="#fig-it4it-reference-architecture-levels">Figure 76</a>.

It depicts, at a high level, the foundational controls an IT organization needs in place to standardize, automate, and generally manage the IT4IT Value Streams.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>At this level, six core concepts are introduced that are central to the IT4IT Reference Architecture body of work:

</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="def-value-stream">11.7.2. Value Stream
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>A value stream describes the key value-creating activities for discrete areas within the Value Network where some unit of net value is created or added to the Digital Product as it progresses through its lifecycle. The IT4IT Reference Architecture defines seven essential value streams for digital management. These are referred to as the IT4IT Value Streams; see <a href="#fig-L0-B-diagram">Figure 5</a>.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Notation and Naming</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Standard has both a simplified notation and a notation aligned with the ArchiMate language, as pictured in <a href="#fig-value-stream-notation">Figure 77</a>.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>As a general rule, the IT4IT Value Streams are named using:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>A verb that describes the essence of what the value stream is doing
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Note that occasionally the verb can be used in connection with the essential (backbone) data object that the value stream works on. This is only in the description, and not the normative name. Also note that this document breaks with the tradition of using a x2y notation like “Detect to Correct”. This brings it more in line with how similar value streams are named in some Agile frameworks. Finally note that the value streams are not prepended with the word “continuous”, which is often found in Agile text books. The prepending of "continuous" is considered a maturity construct and should not be part of the name.

</div></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="def-functional-groups">11.7.3. Functional Groups
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Reference Architecture uses the ArchiMate grouping construct as a way of grouping the functional components and data objects together to provide context for the functionality that organizations must deliver.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>This can be used as a basis for capability planning in an organization but the standard does not prescribe what capabilities a Digital Organizations should build.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The normative IT4IT Standard defines a grouping at two levels:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Level 1: five high level groups of functionalities
</p></li><li><p>Level 2: further decomposition into 14 groups
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>At Level 1, the IT4IT Standard defines the following functional groups:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Strategy to Portfolio (Plan)
</p></li><li><p>Requirement to Deploy (Build)
</p></li><li><p>Request to Fulfill (Deliver)
</p></li><li><p>Detect to Correct (Run)
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>As well as the Support functions that are referenced but are not normative definitions in the IT4IT Standard.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Each one of these is then further decomposed at Level 2 to provide more structure to the reference architecture.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Note that the groupings are simply a way of grouping related functional components together to be able to talk about functionality in a more abstract way, such as Support functions, Assure functions, or simply Run functions. When the IT4IT Reference Architecture is used to implement digital management in a real organization it is necessary to also do capability mapping, as it remains an important activity for organizations. Detailed capabilities that would include process and people aspects are not included as part of the normative documentation. Instead, other documents (guidance documents) will provide this level of detail. The objective of the IT4IT Reference Architecture is to convey, in a prescriptive fashion, the key data objects, relationships, and components that are foundational for all IT organizations. <a href="#fig-capability-example">Figure 78</a> gives an example of a possible decomposition of the IT4IT normative Level 1 and Level 2 groups into detailed capabilities.

</div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>There is also Supporting Functionality within the Value Network model, such as Supplier &amp; Vendor Management, Workforce Management, and Financial Management. As with detailed capabilities, these do not define the Supporting Functions in details, but do define some of the essential data objects and functional components that are expected from the Supporting Functions in order for the primary functionality and value streams to work.

</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="def-functional-component">11.7.4. Functional Component
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>A functional component is the smallest unit of technology that can stand on its own and be useful as a whole to a Digital Practitioner (or IT organization). It must have defined input(s) and output(s) that are data objects and must have an impact on a key data object that it controls. Typically, a functional component controls and/or manages a single key data object, but this is not dictated by the architecture; it can control several, especially if they are intrinsically connected.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Examples of functional components include Event, Product Backlog, Defect, etc. The IT4IT Reference Architecture contains only those functional components that have an impact on key data objects. There will be other technology components and management systems used by IT organizations in the normal course of business, but that are not considered part of the prescriptive IT4IT Reference Architecture. Examples of these types of components could include Corporate Finance systems, HR applications, and Contract Management systems. These will be supplied by the Supporting Capabilities. These are not normative but in some cases the reference architecture will make reference to those.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Notation and Naming</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Reference Architecture uses both a simplified and an ArchiMate notation style. At Level 1, the informal notation renders primary functional components as blue rectangles (see <a href="#fig-functional-component-notation">Figure 80</a>). Secondary functional components are rendered as gray rectangles. Functional components are represented formally in the ArchiMate language using the “Application Function” type.
</p></div><div id="fig-functional-component-notation" class="imageblock text-center"><div class="content"><img src="it4it/3.0/standard.singlepage/images/functional-component-notation.png" alt="functional component notation" width="60%" /></div><div class="title">Figure 80. Functional Component Notation
</div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>As a general rule, the IT4IT Functional Components are named using:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>A noun or a noun with a qualifier that describes the essence of what the functional component is managing
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Occasionally the name is appended with the word “component” as a shorthand for “functional component”.
</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="def-key-data-object">11.7.5. Key Data Object
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>A Key Data Object represents data (records, information, and so on) that annotate or model an aspect of a Digital Product being planned, developed, offered, or consumed. Data objects can take a digital or physical form and can be comprised of structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data. Our definition of Key Data Object is aligned contextually with the Object Management Group<sup>®</sup> (OMG<sup>®</sup>) definition of artifact. In UML, the OMG defines artifact as:
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><em>“… the specification of a physical piece of information that is used or produced by a software development process, or by deployment and operation of a system. Examples of artifacts include model files, source files, scripts, and binary executable files, a table in a database system, a development deliverable, or a word processing document, a mail message.”</em> [<a href="#UML">UML</a>]
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Examples of data objects include incident records, training videos, requirements documents, etc. These types of data objects contribute in some way to define and control a Digital Product over the course of its lifecycle. There are also “special” data objects that represent an abstraction or view of a specific product; for example, a system diagram, release package, or a binary executable file; this provides a “view” of a product to various personas at different stages of the product lifecycle. These special data objects and their relationships form a “backbone” that binds together all of the information needed to offer and manage a Digital Product, thus they are referred to as Digital Product Backbone data objects.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The central focus of the IT4IT Forum has been to identify the data objects that play a “key” role in the product lifecycle. In other words, the reference architecture focuses exclusively on the data objects that are mandatory for ensuring end-to-end traceability of the product lifecycle operationally and/or financially. There are other data objects used across the digital landscape to facilitate various needs or activities (e.g., company-specific processes), but these are considered to be secondary or auxiliary and outside the prescriptive control of the IT4IT Reference Architecture.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Notation and Naming</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Reference Architecture utilizes both a simplified and an ArchiMate notation for data objects so that the work can be easily understood by both architects and non-architects. In the Level 1 model, a simplified notation that depicts data objects as circles is used. Color is used to specify whether a data object is key data object (black) or a backbone data object (orange). Data objects are modeled formally in the ArchiMate language using the “Data Object” type, as shown in <a href="#fig-key-data-object-notation">Figure 81</a>.
</p></div><div id="fig-key-data-object-notation" class="imageblock text-center"><div class="content"><img src="it4it/3.0/standard.singlepage/images/data-object-notation.png" alt="data object notation" width="60%" /></div><div class="title">Figure 81. Key Data Object Notation
</div></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Text is also important in communicating the concepts represented in the model. According to dual-coding theory, using text and graphics together to convey information is more effective than using either on their own. Further, the IT4IT Reference Architecture attempts to avoid using text that creates collisions between architectural layers (e.g., business function, data, and implementation layers). Level 1 introduces naming conventions for data objects that are rooted in the well-known IT frameworks and standards.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>While a functional component may control one or more data object types, a single data object can <em>only</em> be controlled by one functional component. To communicate this visually, a notation that embeds the “controlled” data object in the functional component is used; see <a href="#fig-functional-component-data-object-notation">Figure 82</a>.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Diagrams can be complex and require clear “visual syntax” to help the reader interpret the elements and their relationships. For that reason, the IT4IT Reference Architecture at Level 1 is depicted without data flows and a reduced set of data relationships; see <a href="#fig-L1-diagram">Figure 7</a>.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>As a general rule, the IT4IT Data Objects are named using:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>A noun that describes the essence of what the data object is controlling

</div></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="def-system-of-record">11.7.6. System of Record
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>A system of record is a synonym for a system that contains and/or controls authoritative source data.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The key data objects represent the authoritative source data and/or master data for managing digital. In IT, “system of record” is a term that is commonly used as a synonym for an authoritative source system.

</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>An important aspect of the IT4IT Reference Architecture is to define not only the data objects but the essential relationships between them. The data objects, combined with their relationships and inter-dependencies, form the “system of record fabric” for digital management (see <a href="#fig-relationship-notation">Figure 83</a> and <a href="#fig-end-to-end-traceability">Figure 84</a>).
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Note that in this document there are no defined “reflective” relationships, where a data object can relate to other data objects of its own type; for instance, the Digital Product data object relates to all the Digital Products on which it depends, the Service Offers can represent a hierarchy of offers, or Events can relate to Events to represent correlation. A future version of the IT4IT Standard will include these relations.
</p></div><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Notation and Naming</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Abstraction Level 1 expresses essential relationships as lines between the participating data objects.

</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>The normative definition of the IT4IT Value Streams at the Level 2 abstraction is complemented by the normative definition at Level 3 of:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Functional components
</p></li><li><p>Data objects
</p></li><li><p>Object relations
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>All of which have already been introduced at Level 1.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The normative definition of the functional components and data objects introduces a few more concepts:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Data objects including key attributes
</p></li><li><p>Relationships between data objects are updated with cardinality information (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
</p></li><li><p>The concept of data flow between functional components is introduced
</p></li><li><p>The data flows are grouped into record integrations and engagement integrations
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="_key_attributes">11.9.1. Key Attributes
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>As described in Levels 1 and 2, data objects represent the data exchanged between functional components. At the Level 3 abstraction it is important to specify the attributes of the objects that <em>must</em> be present (those deemed essential) in the exchange. Here, the minimum set of attributes required to maintain the integrity of the system of record fabric is defined. These attributes also contribute to the formation of the canonical data model that underpins the IT4IT Reference Architecture. Often, IT management products will provide more information/attributes, but at Level 3 only the vendor-independent minimum that should be included is defined.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Note that the specification of a key attribute for a data object only implies that the reference architecture insists that an implementation must support the attributes. It does not specify that every instance of the data object type must have a value associated with the attribute. For example, an approval data attribute will only be filled out if the approval has happened.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The most basic key attributes are a “unique identifier” and the “data object lifecycle status”. Often there will be attributes that identify relationships to other data objects in the IT4IT model.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Notation and Naming</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The ArchiMate language does not have a means to model the concept of attributes. The IT4IT Standard documents the attributes in the description of the individual key data objects. Attributes are documented as a list of name/description parts.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The naming of attributes is without prepended or appended data to the object name. So, in the Incident example above, the IT4IT Standard does <em>not</em> define the identifier attribute for the Incident object to be “IncidentId” or the name attribute to be “IncidentName”. It simply has attribute names such as “Id” and “Name”. If there is a need to specify the Identity (Id) of a particular data object, then the usual dot notation common in database systems is used:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>The “Id” of the Incident data object can be referred to as “Incident.Id”
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Standard aims to reuse attribute names that denote the same thing across data object definitions to facilitate the ease of implanting systems using inheritance and to ease the management of different objects in a coherent way.
</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><h4 id="_cardinality">11.9.2. Cardinality
</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>Cardinality (sometimes referred to as “multiplicity”) describes the number of allowable relations a given element can have with elements of a given other type.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>For example, there is a one-to-n (1:n) relationship between “Order” and “Change” data objects. This indicates that a single order can result in multiple change requests. In the instance of a “laptop” Order, a change request might require a request for the laptop to be allocated and configured and a further change for a corporate user account to be security configured for mobile work. Therefore, one Order generated multiple Change objects, and relations must be maintained to each.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Reference Architecture only defines the key relationships – those that contribute to the advancement of the Digital Product lifecycle. There are other relationships that may be needed to satisfy the specific policies, processes, or capabilities but they are not considered to be part of the prescriptive guidance. Further, relationships may be maintained simply to optimize the implementation; for example, the Actual Product Instance might have a relationship back to the Digital Product data object, of which it is an instance. This relationship could be derived through the relationships across the Digital Product Backbone. The normative IT4IT Standard does not make recommendations for such optimizations.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>In UML, the concept of multiplicity extends the definition/understanding/concept of cardinality by including more information on participation; i.e., what relationships must exist, or not. The IT4IT Standard does not specify multiplicity.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The IT4IT Standard only differentiates between three types of cardinality, as shown in <a href="#Three-Types-Cardinality">Table 29</a>.

</h4><div class="paragraph"><p>In Level 1, key data objects and their relationships are introduced. In Level 2, how data objects are consumed or created/updated by the value streams is described. In Level 3, all the necessary key data objects and relationships are defined to form a consistent and traceable information model for managing Digital Products.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>In order for the system of record relationships to be sustained over the course of the product lifecycle, integrations between functional components controlling the key data objects must be well defined. This requires that some data flows need to be “refined” into system of record integration specifications. These specifications become part of the normative IT4IT Standard.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>For a data flow to be refined into a system of record integration, the following conditions must be satisfied:
</p></div><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>The data flow creates a relationship/dependency between two data objects in the functional components involved in the data flow
</p></li><li><p>The two data objects must have a direct relationship to be maintained
</p></li><li><p>The lifecycles of the two data objects are interlocked; updates to one data object can have consequences on the other data object
</p></li></ul></div><div class="paragraph"><p>The reason for defining these integrations as part of the architecture is to ensure the integrity of the system of record fabric and the service model. IT organizations are likely to implement products from multiple suppliers for their IT4IT Reference Architecture, and without this specification there is no way to ensure consistency in data flows.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>A system of record integration is depicted in <a href="#fig-Data-Object-State-Model-Dependency-Illustration">Figure 89</a>.

These relationships are called “system of engagement” integrations (experience-centric integration) and are derived from value stream use-cases and user stories. They are offered as guidance rather than prescriptive practices; the intent being to demonstrate to the reader how data object relationships stimulate and/or are affected by human-to-machine and machine-to-machine interactions.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>For example, the Incident to Knowledge system of engagement integration “Search Knowledge” (see <a href="#fig-incident_functional_component">Figure 65</a>) indicates that a common use-case for managing an incident is to look up relevant Knowledge Items based on the Incident information and potentially create a link to the most relevant ones. But unlike a system of record integration we do not specify that there is a long-lived maintained relationship, such as when an incident is updated then the Knowledge Item needs to be updated, or that updates to Knowledge Items should result in updates to the related Incidents.
</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Notation and Naming</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>At Level 3, the normative notation depicts system of record integrations using a black dotted line with a solid end-arrow accompanied by the name of the data object that is transferred to create the relationship.

The formal notation in the ArchiMate language uses the collaboration and interaction concepts.
